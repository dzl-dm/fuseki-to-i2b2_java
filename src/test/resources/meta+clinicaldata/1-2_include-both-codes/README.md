# Include both codes

## Feature being tested
Either notation/code can be used to match a concept.

## Example data overview
The metadata has 1 top-level concept node with 2 notations.

The sample clinical data has 3 observations, 1 from each of 3 patients. 2 patients match 1 notation for the concept, while the 3rd patient matches the 2nd notation for the concept.

The query should confirm all 3 patients have a matching notation.
